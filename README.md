**Inspiration**
Hajj Amaan is designed to help the Hajj main organizers and admins to monitor and utilize Hajj scouts, every year thousands of Saudi youth scouts participate in organizing this pilgrim. Hajj Amaan will help to organize the reporting process for any Hajj-related issue.

**What it does**
We propose this app to help every scout person and Hajj organizer from any organization to report any Hajj-related issue to system admins. The system admins are the main Hajj organizers like Police, Civil defense, Emergency, cleaning department, and others. The system admins will receive the Issues based on their location; by meaning, only the nearest related department will be notified. The system stores all the data in the database to allow future analysis and better management. The location is automatically detected by the mobile phone and then will be stored in the database, the nearest related authority representative will be notified. The status of each issue is updated until the issue is closed.

**How we built it**
We used Firebase as the main database backend, two other mobile apps for both IOS and Android for the main work. Mobile GPS and Camera is required to use the app and report with issue location and photo.

**Challenges we ran into**
Less amount of data regarding Hajj organizers, and stats. Some small programming challenges that can be solved with time.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We finished the main idea functions.

**What we learned**
